# Randomised controlled trials in critical care do not use real-world causal evidence for planned predictive enrichment: a scoping review

This is the repository for the above-mentioned scoping review with the software used to produce the results reported therein as well as clean data and data documentation.

## Data and analytic code 
Folder: `analysis/`

The analytic code comprises a Quarto notebook (source and HTML version) inside an RStudio project that uses `renv` for reproducibility. The dataset is available in [analysis/public_data.tsv](analysis/public_data.tsv) (tabulator separated)tsv and [analysis/public_data.arrow](analysis/public_data.arrow) (Apache Arrow IPC file = Feather v2 format), and contains data on the following 22 variables:

| **Name**                            | **Type** | **Remark**                               |

The folder also contains [analysis/included_trials.bib](analysis/included_trials.bib) with bibliographic information for all 315 articles included in the review (one article reported two distinct trials). The analysis notebook can be previewed at [https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/epiben/scr-ceppe/blob/main/analysis/analysis_notebook.html#table-1-summary-statistics-of-categorical-variables](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/epiben/scr-ceppe/blob/main/analysis/analysis_notebook.html#table-1-summary-statistics-of-categorical-variables).

## Extraction form
The extraction form was a fairly simple Shiny app and self-hosted on my Raspberry Pi 4 (see below) along with a Postgres database, running as two services (set up in the [shiny-server/docker-compose.yaml](shiny-server/docker-compose.yaml)).

### Shiny app 
Folder: `shiny-server/apps/shiny-app/`

Conventional two-file setup plus one helper script. The `internal` folder contains an SQL dump file for setting up the Postgres database and a .csv file with login credentials of extractors. As we did not handle sensitive information, the login credential served mainly to track who extracted what and as a simple barrier for DDOS attacks (our extraction form was an unlikely and utterly uninteresting target for such attacks).

### Docker image for Shiny-server
Folder: `shiny-server-arm-docker/`

To run Shiny server on Raspberry Pi OS, I used the Dockerfile from https://github.com/hvalev/shiny-server-arm-docker with minor changes to fit our purposes (see top of the [Dockerfile](shiny-server-arm-docker/Dockerfile)).
